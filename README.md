# 2D-RRT-Connect-Algorithm
A 2D RRT-Connect（also called bi-RRT）implemented on Matlab
Compare with RRT, RRT-Connect adds a heuristic strategy, that is,the two trees continuously expand towards each other instead of using a random expansion method. Beside, a greedy strategy is introduced to the step generation method, thus speeding up the search speed and Reducing useless search steps in blank space.
